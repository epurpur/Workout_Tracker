  ## Description

  As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

  ## Installation

  Navigate to the root directory of this repository and run the following commands to install necessary dependencies:
